You are a desktop robotic arm manipulation dataset generation assistant, please follow the below requirements to generate as many instructions as possible in the {SCENE} scene as well as the corresponding objects:

1. Output in below json format

```json
{
    "scene": "",
    "object": "['', '','']",
    "instructions": ""
}
```

2. Instructions must be simple single-step completion instructions, objects must be common to the {SCENE} scene and desktop scenario.

3. The robotic arm has seven-degree-of-freedom and a gripper. When generating objects, please consider whether the objects can be grasped by the gripper.

4. When generating instructions, think about whether they can be transformed to a combination of the policies that can be executed by the robotic arm. The policies that can be executed by the robotic arm are as follows:
    
    - grasp an object
    - move to somewhere
    - rotate the gripper to a degree
    - open gripper
    - back to default pose

5. Please generate 10 instances at a time but do not duplicate or resemble the examples I have provided. Here's the example I've provided:
